"""Curated result archive for one finished TT/LibreLane run directory.

Consumer copy, adapted from hardcaml_asic's scripts/archive.py at the revision
recorded in tinytapeout/asic-dependencies.lock. It differs from the library's
copy only in loading adopted_phase4.py. Keep it in step when that lock moves.

./flow.sh runs this as its eighth stage, so an ordinary full flow promotes its
own run into flow_results/ without anyone remembering to. Run it by hand for a
run some earlier invocation produced.

A run directory is ~235 MB, most of it intermediate stage state and redundant
layout formats (odb, mag, mag_gds) that nothing reads again. This copies the
immutable records out, tars the reports an acceptance decision is read from
together with the two final artifacts a resubmission or a re-check needs, and
verifies every hash those records already pin.

What is kept is an explicit list, not a size rule. What belongs in evidence is
decided by what a reader has to check; a size threshold would silently drop a new
report the first time a flow stage grew one, and silently admit a big one.

Deliberately NOT kept: the compiled gate-level simulator (checks/*/gate.out, 9 MB
of iverilog output) and every intermediate stage directory. Both are rebuildable
from what is kept plus the pinned toolchain, and neither is read by a check.

Careful: this does not write the README.md that sits beside the records in
evidence/p4/*. That note is the human account of what the run showed, and a
generated stand-in would read as though someone had checked the result.

Usage:
  ./flow.sh archive                                 # the run this invocation made
  PROTEMU_RUN=/path/to/run ./flow.sh archive        # an earlier run
  tinytapeout/scripts/adopted_archive.py RUN_DIR --output flow_results/NAME
  tinytapeout/scripts/adopted_archive.py RUN_DIR --output DIR --force
  tinytapeout/scripts/adopted_archive.py RUN_DIR --list   # selection only, writes nothing

A run whose status is not "completed" is refused: there is no point pinning
hashes for a run that never finished. Its directory stays where it is, and the
flow summary still names it.
